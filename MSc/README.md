# Application of Tensor CP Decomposition in Image Compression

## Under the supervision of Prof. Swanand R. Khare, Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur

### Overview:
Images are nothing but a higher dimensional array or Tensors in mathematical language. Tensor CP Decomposition is a technique to find <i>lower dimensional approximation</i> of a tensor. By using the <b>Alternative Least Square (ALS)</b> approximation method we implemented this alogorithm python notebook file with some examples of Image Compression.
