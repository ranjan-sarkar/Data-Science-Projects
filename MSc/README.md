# Application of Tensor CP Decomposition in Image Compression

### Overview:
Image are nothing but a higher dimensional array or Tensors in mathematical language. Tensor CP Decomposition is a technique to find lower dimensional approximation of a tensor. By using the Alternative Least Square (ALS) approximation method we implemented this alogorithm python notebook file with some examples of Image Compression.
